## Steps To Create A Flask App
  * *We created a new folder and created a new virtual environment.*

  * *We created a simple hello world application.*
  * *We ran the code and saw the output on the web browser*
  * *Then we learned about the GET ,POST, PUT and DELETE methods.*
      * *GET - gets information.*
      * *POST - Duplicates the information.*
      * *PUT - Put makes changes in information.*
      * *DELETE - Deletes the information.*
  * *We also created a web application which used GET and POST methods. And allowed us to view and add tasks to the list.*

  * *We run the code and copied the link.*
  * *We tested the GET method using postman.*
  * *Then we tested the POST method.*
